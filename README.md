# 🐾 Modern Pokedex
 
 ## 📜 Description
 
 This app shows more than 850 Pokémon in cards, contain their names, types and images. I used HTML/CSS for design and I used JavaScript to fetch API and algorithm. The API I used is called PokeAPI.
 
 
 ## 📖 What I've learned
 
 I made this project mostly to learn how to use fetch API, and this was a great experience, I have not learned just how to get information from API, but also use them, improving my JS skills too.
